# Object-level-spatiotemporal-fusion-models

A flexible object-level (OL) processing strategy is proposed to raise the efficiency of several popluar spatiotemporal fusion methods including STARFM, ESTARFM, Fit-FC, FSDAF and FSDAF 2.0. The OL fusion versions of STARFM, ESTARFM, and Fit-FC can better preserve the structural information, and were 102.89–113.71, 92.77–115.73, and 30.51–36.15 times faster than their original methods (the 1.1 version of OL-Fit-FC is about 50 times faster than Fit-FC). In addition, an object-level hybrid spatiotemporal fusion method (OL-HSTFM) were proposed, which incorporates the efficiency advantage of object-level fusion strategy, spectral accuracy advantage of the three-step method (Fit-FC), and the spatial accuracy advantage of the spatial and temporal adaptive reflectance fusion model (STARFM).

Please double-click OLfusionv1.1.exe to install OL-fusionAPP and MATLAB Runtime version 9.9 (R2020b). Make sure you are connected to the network and anti-virus software (e.g., 360) is turned off during installation.
